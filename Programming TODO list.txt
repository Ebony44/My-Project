Raycast issue
	Check the Layermask's layer properties.
	and wall's colider and rigidbody, ....etc

Turning function -> solved

Slerp, Lerp method  -> understood


04-23

Understand and be familiar with Trigonometric fucntions

Player.cs

Polishing the movement
	make transient moveline(through border)
	-> modify SetupBoundaries()

set X, Y boundary => Camera's size
or
search the scroll roll on screen


	

RangedWeapon.cs



Raycast issue  -->solved --> expansion issue. if Enemy.cs use this...  overload?
	Check the Layermask's layer properties.
	and wall's colider and rigidbody, ....etc

-solution 1
	make mousePosition Vector 2 not Vector3
	->Z axis may cause problems.
->solution 2
	..well after solution 1 failed
	

expansion issue 
	Enemy class will use this or it's child
	make it struct or derived class

Projectile Initiating

Enemy Spawning

0425~0426

MeleeWeapon.cs

-Projectile reflecting
-Guarding function


0429 in company

- grab some Background image -> solved
- Coroutine -> understand again to use. -> solved
- make some model for enemies -> maybe delayed

Hitscan(float acc, float firstFireRate)
-> adjust timing(delete lineRenderer, firing period)

what is afterFireRate => fire interval time between each fire

-> Fire() or Hitscan() -> every weapon has it's own fireRate so it should be Fire()


etc

bullet, laser, rocket
accuracy -> modifying Y values

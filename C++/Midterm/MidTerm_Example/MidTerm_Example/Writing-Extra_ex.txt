1.1 Floating point to decimal

i) Sign
ii) Exponent
iii) Mantissa

i) Sign is the first bit (1) 10000011 00010000000000000000000 
ii) Exponent is next 8 bit 1 (10000011) 00010000000000000000000 
	-> decided by the nearest smaller or equal to 2n number. (for example, 17 is 2^4 = 16)

iii) Mantissa is rest of all. 1 10000011 (00010000000000000000000)

ex)

1 10000011 00010000000000000000000 
Sign: it's negative (first bit is 1)
Exponent: it's 17( 10000011 ->  )

1 10000011 00010000000000000000000 = -17   16 * (1 + 1/16) = 16 * 1.125 = 17.xxx
131 - 127 = 4 -> 2 ^ 4 = 16
1 10000011 10100000000000000000000 = -26    16 * (1 + 1/2 + 1/8) = 16 * 1.625 = 26.xxx
131 - 127 -> 2 ^ 4 = 16
0 10000000 10000000000000000000000 = 3		2 * (1 + 1/2 ) = 3
128 - 127 - > 2 ^ 1 = 2

1. Inline
	- worked by compiler
		inline functions are parsed by compiler
	- defined inside or outside the class

	- The compiler may not inline and expand all the functions

	- An inline member function can access the data members of the class.
	
2. Macro
	- worked by preprocessor
		the macros are expanded by preprocessor
	- always defined a the start of the program

	- Macros are always expanded 

	- Macros can never be the members of the class and can not access the data members of the class.
